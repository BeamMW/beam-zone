### Overview

Nephrite is a non-custodial, decentralized, censorship-resistant, governance-less confidential stablecoin on the Beam blockchain. It combines stability with privacy by pegging a confidential asset to an external asset while overcollateralizing it with the BEAM cryptocurrency.

Nephrite utilizes the elegant Mimblewimble privacy protocol and runs on the secure Proof-of-Work Beam blockchain. It inherits the capital efficiency and elegant design of Liquity but with critical improvements like strict liquidation order, automatic stabilization mechanisms, and distributed frontends.

Nephrite aims to provide individuals and businesses with a stable anonymous digital cash that protects privacy in the digital economy.
